The undo/redo file is designed using two stacks that follow a Last in first out order.
This makes it perfert for tracking recent user movements meaning every action performed is
pushed into the stack. This makes undoing items really easy using the pop function and allows 
redoing items easy as well. This is similer to what colaberative editors like google docs. 
The help desk file is designed by using a queue system in order to track tickets. This follows
a First in first our order That makes sure to go in order of who gets in first is served first.
This is how most support systems operate giving fairness all around.
